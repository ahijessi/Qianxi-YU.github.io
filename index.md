## About Me

I am a recent MA graduate in Linguistics from Nanjing University of Science and Technology as of March 2024. I am currently working as a research assistant at Zhejiang University.

During my MA journey, I focused on the language development of children with cochlear implants, particularly in Mandarin tone production and irony comprehension. I had the privilege of being supervised by Associate Professor Tang Ping and receiving guidance from Assistant Professors Li Shanpeng and Li Honglan, as well as Professor Chen Yin at the LIPA lab in NJUST.

Now, as I begin my role at Zhejiang University under the guidance of Professor Ding Nai, I’m expanding my horizons by exploring the neural mechanisms of auditory attention and children’s syntactic awareness development.

I am particularly interested in the language development of both typical and atypical children, utilizing both behavioural and neural experiments. My focus is on the role of multimodal cues, such as prosody and facial expressions, in daily communication and exploring the mechanisms behind these effects.

With a background in Linguistics, especially in phonetics, I am also deeply interested in psychology and neuroscience. I look forward to engaging in more multidisciplinary projects in the future.
